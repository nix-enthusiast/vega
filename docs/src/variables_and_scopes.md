# Variables and Scopes

Variables are named pointers that point to data in the call stack or the heap. 

Scopes are boundaries defined by functions (including anonymous ones), enums, unions, structs, or classes. 

Vega takes a simple yet robust approach to both variables and scopes, ensuring behavioral correctness and type safety.
