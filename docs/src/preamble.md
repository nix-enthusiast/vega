# Preamble

In the software world, there are many programming languages with different paradigms and approaches for completing a given task.

Naturally, this has led to many interesting - and often fascinating - outcomes. It is undeniable that C++, Rust, Java, Erlang, Go, Haskell, and OCaml are both inspired by their priors and influenced many came after.

Therefore, it is very normal that many languages of this diverse world became torchbearers for Vega's design. To elaborate further, Vega is influenced by: 

  - [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) for its simple syntax and small set of keywords
  - [Golang](https://go.dev/) for its single and robust way to do things, along with its profound system call library and simple FFI to cooperate with the system and 3rd party libraries
  - [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for its dynamic typing system
  - [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) for its lightweight and flexible concurrency
  - [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) for its balanced approach to the functional and imperative programming paradigms

Vega is licensed with [BSD-3 Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/). Hence, please feel free to tinker internals, look how they work and release your own Vega version.
